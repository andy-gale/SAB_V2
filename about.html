                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2025 by a group of college students at UCSB, Share-A-Bite provides a platform for convenient, community-based food sharing. 
                    Our mission is simple: to connect people with excess food to those who need it, creating a sustainable solution to food waste while fostering a sense of community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every year, millions of pounds of prepared food go to waste in restaurants, homes, and events within our local neighborhoods. 
                    As broke college students ourselves, we saw this as an opportunity to make a difference. Rising food costs, economic uncertainty, 
                    and the prevalence of food insecurity motivated us to develop a platform that empowers people to share surplus food in a safe and effective way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Share-A-Bite bridges the gap between those who have extra food and those who experience food insecurity. Whether you’re a restaurant owner with leftover meals at the end of the day, 
                    a home cook with extra portions, or someone who just wants to give back, Share-A-Bite makes it easy to connect with others in your community who can benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to create a world where no food goes to waste, and everyone has access to nutritious meals. We believe in:
